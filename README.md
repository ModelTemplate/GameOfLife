# GameOfLife #
>_Conway's Game Of Life in JavaScript (Node.js)_

## About ##
Showcasing a multidimensional array vs. an object-oriented approach to this problem.

Developed in Node.js v13.2.0

## Future Improvements? ##
* Use a faster algorithm to compute cell states
  * Develop a GUI for the game
* Allow user input
* Expand into 3-dimensional space / grid wrapping
* Implement asynchronous capabilities
  * Example: stop game while it is running -> add new cells -> continue game
* Implement true object-oriented programming styles in JavaScript
  * Private fields; making them only accessible by getters and setter methods
  * Private methods (use TypeScript or Babel compiler)
  * Inheritance? Maybe not for this program specifically
