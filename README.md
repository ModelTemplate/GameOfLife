# GameOfLife #
>_Conway's Game Of Life in JavaScript (Node.js)_

## About ##
Showcasing a multidimensional array vs. an object-oriented approach to this problem. Prints out grids in the terminal that represents each generation of a Game of Life. Runs up to 25 generations, but can be modified to run indefinitely.

Developed in Node.js v13.2.0

## How To Run ##
In your desired terminal, go to the file destination of this program and then type:
`node GameOfLifeFinal.js`

To quit the program: `^C`

## Future Improvements? ##
* Use a faster algorithm to compute cell states
* Develop a GUI for the game
  * Allow user input
* Expand into 3-dimensional space / grid wrapping
* Implement asynchronous capabilities
  * Example: stop game while it is running -> add new cells -> continue game
* Implement true object-oriented programming styles in JavaScript
  * Private fields; making them only accessible by getters and setter methods
  * Private methods (use TypeScript or Babel compiler)
  * Inheritance? Maybe not for this program specifically
